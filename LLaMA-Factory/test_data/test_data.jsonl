That’s important. If they were doing individual moves or using props, I’d see that here, but it looks like they’re focused on matching each other.</think>  \n\nHmm, let’s see what specific movements they’re doing...  \n\n<time>01:08-02:56</time>  \n<caption>They move back and forth, up and down, and shake their chests.</caption>  \n<think>Interesting—they’re not just standing still or doing isolated footwork. They’re all doing the same actions at the same time, like a mirror effect. The chest shakes are synchronized, and the back-and-forth movement seems deliberate and uniform.</think>  \n\nNow, looking at the options:  \n- **(A) Props?** Nope, I don’t see any objects being used—just bodies.  \n- **(B) Footwork?** Movement is happening, but it’s not just about the feet; their whole bodies are involved.  \n- **(C) Unique individual moves?** Not at all—they’re all copying each other.  \n- **(D) Slow transitions?** The movements seem deliberate but not particularly slow.  \n- **(E) Moving in unison?** Yeah, that matches perfectly—they’re all doing the same thing together.  \n\nThe answer is **E**—the dancers are clearly moving in unison with coordinated steps.", "solution": "<answer>E</answer>", "path": "v_nY8a1E4QH5Q.mp4", "data_source": "ActivityNet", "dataset": "activitynet"}
